# My Network Lab: Network is Power

Welcome to my space to document my discoveries and projects in the networking world! Here I will share my experiences, configurations and learnings.

## Networking Projects

Here you will find the different labs and experiments I am doing:

* **Project 1: Demystifying the OSI Model with the Odroid**.
    * A journey through the 7 layers of the OSI model, using the Odroid to capture and analyze real traffic.
    * [Go to Lab OSI/Odroid (Coming Soon)](/projects/lab-osi-odroid.md)

* **Project 2: Advanced Pi-hole Configuration** **Project 3: Advanced Pi-hole Configuration** **Project 4: Advanced Pi-hole Configuration
    * Exploring functionality beyond ad blocking, such as the use of DNS-over-HTTPS.
    * [Go to the Pi-hole Lab (Coming Soon)](/projects/lab-pihole.md)

## Tools in my Lab

These are the main tools I use in my experiments:

* ** **Odroid N2+ with Armbian:** My main platform for most labs.
* ** **Tshark/Wireshark:** Essential for deep packet analysis and debugging.
** **Pi-hole:** My network-level DNS blocker and query observer.
* Nmap/Zenmap:** For scanning and discovery of devices on the network.
* My Routers (Main and AP):** The base infrastructure of my network.
